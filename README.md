**Property Value Modeling in João Pessoa, PB**

This project is part of my final undergraduate thesis in Statistics, focusing on modeling property values in the city of João Pessoa, PB, using machine learning techniques.

The aim of the study is to predict property values based on various features such as property size, number of rooms, location, and other characteristics. The project explores several machine learning models to improve prediction accuracy, including gradient boosting, and random forests.
